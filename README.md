# Liquid Code : Users Model

A standard user model for Liquid Code + compatible projects (in go).

## Usage

'Users' are considered an abstract type. You're certainly welcome to use this project directly if you like, but for more concrete functionality, please refer to the Liquid Code Persons projects (Persons Model, Persons API, Persons UI). (TODO: link)
